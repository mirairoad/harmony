**SOFTWARE by Hushkey** — the studio site listing the products we ship. A
single Howl app, Tailwind v4 + daisyUI, JSON-driven, with status-aware
product cards that drill into per-product detail pages.

## Setup

```sh
deno install
cp .env.example .env
deno task dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

## Environment

| Variable        | Default        | Purpose                              |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `APP_NAME`      | `Software`     | Brand title — shown in header / tab  |
| `DENO_PORT`     | `8000`         | Dev / start server port              |
| `DENO_HOSTNAME` | `127.0.0.1`    | Dev / start server bind hostname     |

## Editing the site

Everything is JSON. No DB, no CMS — edit a file, save, refresh.

1. **Studio profile** — name, kicker, tagline, about, social links and the
   team grid live in [`server/cv/profile.json`](server/cv/profile.json).
2. **Products list** — [`server/cv/projects/manifest.json`](server/cv/projects/manifest.json)
   is the ordered list of cards. Each entry has a `status` of `"shipped"`,
   `"production"` or `"archived"` — the home page badge picks colour from there.
3. **Product detail** — drop a JSON file under
   [`server/cv/projects/`](server/cv/projects/) (same shape as
   [`howl.json`](server/cv/projects/howl.json)) and register the import in
   [`server/cv/reader.ts`](server/cv/reader.ts) — the file ships with commented
   examples showing exactly where.

The slug in the project JSON body, the manifest entry, and the registry key
must all match.

## Status model

| Status         | Visual                          | Use for                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `shipped`      | Green check + "Shipped"         | Released and available (Howl, Hound)        |
| `production`   | Pulsing primary + "In production" | Running in production with users (Hushkey) |
| `archived`     | Muted "Archived"                | No longer maintained                        |

## Page anatomy

The home page has four stacked sections:

1. Hero — centered glow logo, kicker, big `SOFTWARE.` wordmark, "by Hushkey"
2. **Products** — single grid of every product, each with its status badge
3. **Team** — accent-coloured initials cards with optional GitHub link
4. About + contact CTA in a single rounded panel

Top-right nav (`Products` / `Team` / `Get in touch`) anchor-scrolls on the
home page; the gallery (`/projects`) lists every product with the same
status badges.

## Public APIs

The same data the pages render is also exposed as JSON:

| Endpoint                             | Returns                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/public/profile`            | Studio profile + team              |
| `GET /api/public/projects`           | Products manifest (with `status`)  |
| `GET /api/public/projects/:slug`     | A single product detail            |
| `GET /api/public/ping`               | Health probe                       |

## Production

```sh
deno task build && deno task start          # plain Deno run
deno task build && deno task compile         # single-binary
```
